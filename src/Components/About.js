        Hello, my name is Pankaj Pal and I am a Full Stack Developer with 3 years of experience in the industry. I specialize in using the MERN stack to create dynamic and engaging web applications.

I am deeply passionate about web development and I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends. My commitment to delivering high-quality work is reflected in everything I do and I take pride in creating web applications that are both functional and visually appealing.

I am currently working as an Associate Technology L1 at Publicis re:sources, where I have the opportunity to work on exciting projects and further hone my skills. In my previous role, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at Flexsin Technology, where I had the opportunity to work on challenging projects and develop my skills in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

Whether working independently or in a team environment, I bring my passion, creativity, and technical expertise to every project I undertake. I believe in the power of web development to transform businesses and I am excited to continue creating innovative solutions that drive results.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with you and discussing how we can work together to achieve your goals.
